## Introduction

Welcome to the Data Consultant Technical Assesment! 

This test consists of 2 sections into different folders, focusing on the specifics of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and SQL queries. 

Your goal is to complete these tasks and submit your solutions via pull request.

## Sections and Tasks

Each section contains a `README.md` file and a `docs` folder with the tasks and instructions, each with its own set of instructions and requirements. 

Please read the instructions carefully and make sure you understand the objectives before starting each task.

## Submission

To submit your solutions, please create a fork of this repository, complete the tasks, and submit a **single!** pull request.

Your pull request should include a brief explanation of your approach, any relevant documentation if needed, and of course, your code.

We look forward to reviewing your submissions and learning more about your technical skills as a Data Consultant.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We assume that you are familiar with Git, GitHub, and pull requests. If you are not familiar with these tools, you may want to learn more about them before attempting to submit your deliverables via pull request.
