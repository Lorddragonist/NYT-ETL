# Presentation and Code Review

If you got to this point, you have completed the tasks for the Data Consultant Technical Assessment, congrats!

This section does not require any code. 

We will do a code-review like presentation of your solutions. Note that we will ask you to share your screen and walk us through your code and your approach to the tasks. Please expect conceptual questions about your code and the decisions you made.

If still needed, you can use section 3 `deliverables` folder to store any additional files you may need to present your solution.

Once you are ready, please sumbit all your work via pull request. Once received we will schedule a session with you :)
